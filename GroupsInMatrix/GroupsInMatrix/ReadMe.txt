So the first question that i was thinking was this: 

========================================================================================================================================================================

Given a matrix with 1s and 0s, please find the number of groups of 1s. A group is defined by horizontally or vertically adjacent 1s.

Example Input:

1  1 0  0  1 
1  0  0  1  0
1  1  0  1  0


1  1 0  0  1 
1  0  0  1  0
1  1  0  1  0


So if you see the same colors are the groups.

Groups can be however munch in length and width dont restrict it in that sense.

========================================================================================================================================================================

Submitting criteria:


Create a "Git Hub" account if you already have one and know how to use the commands and stuff cool :) else its a good way to learn and actually use it.

Once done, submit that code there and then we can share the repositories and check the codes.

Any thoughts?
